Custom CSS
==========

In order to help with the output styling in HTML, Breathe attaches some custom
classes to parts of the document. There are three such classes:

**breatheparameterlist**
   Used to keep the description of a parameter displayed inline with the
   parameter name. The Breathe docs use::

      .breatheparameterlist li tt + p {
              display: inline;
      }

**breatheenumvalues**
   Used to keep the description of an enum displayed inline with the
   enum name. The Breathe docs use::

      .breatheenumvalues li tt + p {
              display: inline;
      }

**breatheprogramlisting**
   Used to render the program listings generated by Breathe in Sphinx's
   preformatted style. Program listings can include reference links to other
   entities in the code base so we cannot use the docutils ``literal_block`` as
   Sphinx does as it does not handle these links.

   So we use a ``line_block`` and style it to appear as close as possible to
   Sphinx standard code blocks. Unfortunately this styling is not picked up in
   latex, so further work is required for that.

   The Breathe docs use::

      .breatheprogramlisting {
          padding: 5px;
          line-height: 120%;
          border: 1px solid #ac9;
          border-left: none;
          border-right: none;

          margin: 1em 0px;

          font-family: monospace;
      }
